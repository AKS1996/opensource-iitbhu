# Prelude to Open-Source:

This is Deepankar Umare, from CSE (Part II). 

As the headline indicates, this moment can be regarded as an inception to Open Source Development for me.
Recently after doing few course projects, a love for development flourished, through me.

And now, I came to know the *whats* and hows of Open-Source and realized its power. 

Here is a brief overview of my wisdom.,(in accordance to the outline given in the Open-Source group)

### Current status in the field of Open-source:

 * Participating in KWoC this winter.

 * Looking forward to participate in GSoC.

 Frankly, its a beginning.Beginning with - A GitHub Repo.
 
 ### Projects:
 * Aadhar-Management-Syetem. GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/DeepankarUmare/Aadhar-Management-System).
 * A basic website implemented in Django.GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/DeepankarUmare/Django-Project)

### Programming languages known:
* C/C++
* Python

### Others:

* Web Development with Django.
* HTML/CSS
* Basic Algorithms in Machine-Learning.

### GitHub Experience:
* I wish I knew git during my Course Projects.Nevertheless, now I do.
* Became aware of **Version-Control** and it's truly worthy.Reduces your time finding bugs and writing code again and again, and most-importantly :maintains an entire life-timeline of your projects. Jump here, jump there, *get your head detached*. Thanks to our seniors.
