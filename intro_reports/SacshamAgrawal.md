# ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
  Hi guys! 
  I am Sacsham Agrawal , most probably a fresher in IIT BHU , from electronics dep. , recovering from the terrifying
  week of end sem , and trying to utilize my vacations to learn some cool stuffs . I learnt bit of coding till my 12th , and realized there whole lot of amazing things worth adding to my treasury. 

## SKILLS
------------------------------------
 there's nothing till now , which i could claim as my skill particularly, as after coming to the rich environment of coding in IIT BHU , i got to know about the fun it is to code and develope ( though didnt developed something till now ). Then aslo i have some credits (  :| though countable using only 2 fingers  :P ):

 +  c
 +  c++ 
 +  java
 +  HTML ( very beginning )
 +  CSS  ( not too much )
 +  JS   ( same learning stage :D )

## INTERESTS and EXPERIENCE 
------------------------------------
-  With a passion of developing web and android apps , as they seems quite interesting , I was greatly fascinated by the wonderful world of technology in which we imagine ourselves in future ,  due to  Machine Learning , Artificial Intelligence , and  deep learning . They seems quite revolutionary , and surely be in my skill set some day.
-  In feild of open source , i am quite new , learnt some basics uploading this repo using terminal on git.I mostly loved the concept of version control and am quite eager to make use of it to the fullest.
-  Hope to get lots of opportunities of learning and doing projects , and able to contribute to it .
