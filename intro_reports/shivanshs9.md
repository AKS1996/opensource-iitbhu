#About me#
Hello to the person who's reading this and thanks to the monitor who's displaying this! I am Shivansh Saini, aka **The Faker**, who's currently learning how to write in markdown. And I was just thinking of writing C in markdown... nope, it won't work out, I guess.
Well, anyways, back to business! I am just a fresher at IIT-BHU and suffering through the end-semester exams these days.

##Skills##
Nope, I can't trace swords or have my inner world materialized and projected onto reality. That's crazy, no? What I can do is limited around computer science stuff or maybe sometimes music.
My current treasury of skills are:
- C
- C++
- Python
- HTML, CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- MySQL
- Game Development
- Web Development (both frontend and backend)

##Experience##
I did start working on CS stuffs from my 7th class. But, since I never got a proper education in school related to CS topics (I **won't** consider HTML as important CS topic), I had kind of a jumbled technical knowledge and had to start from scratch after my 12th class. Even then, I've worked on fan-game projects, translation stuff, programmed windows software, made 3 games so far (one was 3D, other two were 2D), built a simple PHP web application (which implemented simple database and login/register system), did some 3D modelling and animation etc.
I've worked with Git a little before I came here and my experience in open source had been a project, related to translation of a game engine, which is hosted on sourceforge.net (never got to complete it though). Currently learning more about Linux - Arch, to be exact - and how to get full advantage out of it, practicing Git and polishing my programming and algorithmic skills through competitive programming.
